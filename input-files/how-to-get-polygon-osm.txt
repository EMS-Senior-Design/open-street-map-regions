The best way to get a polygon region is to query the Overpass API from terminal.
You could potentially use Postman, but the response from the API is often so large
that it was crashing that app for me, so I recommend using cURL. The command to
take a coordinate set that bounds a polygon and exports the OSM for that
polygon to outputfile.txt is:

curl -d "data=node(poly:\"<coordinate set in lat long lat long format>\"); out meta;" -X POST https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter > outputfile.txt

You can remove the word "meta" from the command if you don't need the metadata.
Not sure all the applications for that yet, but I needed the meta to open the
output file in JavaOpenStreetMap (JOSM, an OSM editor application).

I'll also put a txt file with the query used to get all of Travis County in this folder.
